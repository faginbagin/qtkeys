# qtkeys

Test qt key names for use in mythtv key bindings

## Build as follows:
qmake  
make  

## Use as follows:
./qtkeys test.keys

## Details
test.keys is an example input file that contains a list of key bindings, like those you would get querying the keylist column of mythconverg.keybindings

As you press keys on your keyboard or remote, qtkeys prints details about the key events it receives (key, modifiers, keynum, key name, etc.) and which keylist entries (key sequences) from the input file, if any, contains the key.

The purpose is to validate the key bindings you want to use in mythtv will in fact be recognized by mythtv, and also to vaildate the keys generated by your input device can in fact be received by a Qt applcation like mythtv. Note that some media keys, for example, may be "gobbled up" by desktop environments, unless you change their key bindings. Both Ubuntu (with gnome shell) and Xubuntu (with XFDE), versions 18.04, will not pass through media keys unless you change their key bindings.
